## User Experience

### Project Goals

The idea for Bookworm was created from a need I saw that my mum had. Being a voracious reader, she never knew which books she had sat on her bookshelf at home whilst out purchasing new books. She also finds it difficult to keep track of which book she is currently on in a series, and previous authors she has read who she enjoyed and would like to try more of their work.

I felt that the project could then be taken a step further, and could also provide a way to store reviews on books read together with a rating and the dates read. It would also be nice to make notes about a book, for example, if you have loaned the book out to a friend.

### User Stories

#### Target Audience

The target audience for Bookworm are book lovers all around the world who would like to keep track of their reading and their books.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

As a first time user of the site I want to be able to:

* Understand what the site is for and how to navigate the site.
* Register for an account.
* Search for books.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

As a returning registered user of the site I want to be able to:

* Log in to my account.
* Create, edit, delete and view my bookshelves.
* Create, edit, delete and view my book reviews.

#### Admin User

As an administrator for the site I want to be able to:

* Remove any reviews that are offensive.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I have used [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico#standard-styles) for the headings on the site. I have chosen to use this font as it is a brush script handwriting font which make me think of a fat little bookworm!

![Pacifico Font](documentation/pacifico.png)

I have used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat&category=Sans+Serif) for the body text on the site. Monserrat is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

## Features

The website is comprised of â€¦

### Elements found on each page

* Favicon - Created at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). I have chosen an illustration of an open book as it fit the theme of my site, this image has also been used as the logo for the site - which fosters continuity through the site for users and promotes brand awareness.

![Bookworm favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* Navbar - The Navbar is displayed on all pages of the website and allows users to navigate the site with ease. The navbar is comprised of a logo, the sites name, links to navigate the site and a search bar. The links on the navbar will vary depending on whether a user is logged into their account.

* Footer - A footer is displayed on all pages of the website and contains ***

### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Non-relational database used to store the book information.

[PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) - Python Driver for MongoDB.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational database used to store the users and the bookshelves.

[SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) - Database abstraction library, used to interact with PostgreSQL.

[Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - Tool for installing python packages.

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) - Templating engine.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create wireframes.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control.

[Github](https://github.com/) - To save and store the files for the website.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import the fonts used on the website.

### Google Books API

I have used the Google Books API to allow users of the site to search for books. As I was only searching for books I was able to utilise the Google Books API key instead of using OAuth.

I made use of the Google Books API [documentation](https://developers.google.com/books) to learn how to fetch data from the API. The documentation also allowed me to amend my request to only fetch the fields I plan to use on my site. This reduces the amount of data returned to me and will speed up server processing.
