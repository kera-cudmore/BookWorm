## User Experience

### Project Goals

The idea for Bookworm was created from a need I saw that my mum had. Being a voracious reader, she never knew which books she had sat on her bookshelf at home whilst out purchasing new books. She also finds it difficult to keep track of which book she is currently on in a series, and previous authors she has read who she enjoyed and would like to try more of their work.

I felt that the project could then be taken a step further, and could also provide a way to store reviews on books read together with a rating and the dates read. It would also be nice to make notes about a book, for example, if you have loaned the book out to a friend.

### User Stories

#### __Target Audience__

The target audience for Bookworm are book lovers all around the world who would like to keep track of their reading and their books.

#### __First Time Visitor Goals__

As a first time user of the site I want to be able to:

* Understand what the site is for and how to navigate the site.
* Register for an account.
* Search for books.

#### __Returning Visitor Goals__

## Design

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I have used [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico#standard-styles) for the headings on the site. I have chosen to use this font as it is a brush script handwriting font which make me think of a fat little bookworm!

![Pacifico Font](documentation/pacifico.png)

I have used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat&category=Sans+Serif) for the body text on the site. Monserrat is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

## Features

The website is comprised of â€¦

### Elements found on each page

* Favicon - Created at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). I have chosen an illustration of an open book as it fit the theme of my site, this image has also been used as the logo for the site - which fosters continuity through the site for users and promotes brand awareness.

![Bookworm favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* Navbar - The Navbar is displayed on all pages of the website and allows users to navigate the site with ease. The navbar is comprised of a logo, the sites name, links to navigate the site and a search bar. The links on the navbar will vary depending on whether a user is logged into their account.

### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python

### Databases Used

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Non-relational database used to store the book information.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational database used to store the users and the bookshelves.

### Frameworks Used

[Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) - A microframework.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - version 5.2.0 - CSS Framework.

### Libraries Used

[PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) - Python Driver for MongoDB.

[SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) - Database abstraction library, used to interact with PostgreSQL.

### Programs Used

[Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - Tool for installing python packages.

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) - Templating engine.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create wireframes.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control.

[Github](https://github.com/) - To save and store the files for the website.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import the fonts used on the website.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Version ** - For the iconography on the website.

[Google Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.

[Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) To compress images for use in the readme.

[Birme](https://www.birme.net/) To resize images and convert to webp format for the site.

[Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) To create the favicon.

[Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) To show the website image on a range of devices.

[Shields.io](https://shields.io/) To add badges to the README.

[Postman](https://web.postman.co/) To test the API request parameters for Google Books API.

### Google Books API

I have used the Google Books API to allow users of the site to search for books.

I made use of the Google Books API [documentation](https://developers.google.com/books) to learn how to fetch data from the API. The documentation also allowed me to amend my request to only fetch the fields I plan to use on my site. This reduces the amount of data returned to me and will speed up server processing.

As I am only using the API to search for books, and won't be accessing google books shelves or user login data I have chosen to use an API key for access rather than OAuth. My requests to the API contain my API key, the search term the user has created and the fields that I would like to be returned. I have chosen to only receive the books title, authors, description and thumbnail of the book. I have set up the API request to ask for 30 results maximum.

Update - to enable me to get the books unique ID I have had to pull the complete light version when performing a search. This unfortunately means that I am requesting more information than I need, however currently there is no way to pull in the ID with other fields. In future implementations I would look into using graphql as an alternative to calling the api as this will allow me to specify the exact data I would like to have returned.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The site is deployed using Heroku. To deploy to Heroku:

1. To successfully deploy on Heroku we first need to create some files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

2. The requirements.txt file contains all the applications and dependencies that are required to run the app. To create the requirements.txt file run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

3. The Procfile tells Heroku which files run the app and how to run it. To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo web: python run.py > Procfile
    ```

    NOTE: The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

4. If the Procfile has been created correctly it will have the Heroku logo next to it. It is also important to check the Procfile contents, as sometimes on creation a blank line will be added at the end of the file. This can sometimes cause problems when deploying to Heroku, so if the file contains a blank line at the end, delete this and save the file. Make sure to save both these files and then add, commit and push them to GitHub.

5. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

6. Click the new button and then click create new app.

7. You will then be asked to give your app a name (these must be unique so you cannot reuse bookworm) and select a region. Once these are completed click create app.

8. You will now need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Select GitHub in the deployment section, find the correct repository for the project and then click connect.

9. Once the repository is connected, you will need to provide Heroku some config variables it needs to build the app. Click on the settings tab and then click reveal config vars button. You will now need to add the environment key/value variables that were used in the env.py file:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY| YOUR_SECRET_KEY* |
    | MONGO_URI | MONGO_URI* |
    | MONGO_DBNAME | MONGO_DB* |
    | DATABASE_URL | POSTGRES_DB* |

    *Denotes a value that is specific to your app.

10. You're now ready to click the enable automatic deploys button. Heroku will start building the app. Once complete click the open app button on the dashboard.
